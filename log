⚠️ WARNING: HIVE MULTI-ISOLATE RISK DETECTED ⚠️

Accessing Hive from an unsafe isolate (current isolate: "Closure: (String?) => Future<List<Day>> from Function 'getCache': static.")
This can lead to DATA CORRUPTION as Hive boxes are not designed for concurrent
access across isolates. Each isolate would maintain its own box cache,
potentially causing data inconsistency and corruption.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
- Use IsolatedHive instead
