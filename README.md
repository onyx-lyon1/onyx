## Build

To build the app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

- Install Flutter from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).

- #### Linux
  You will need those libraries:
  - pkg-config
  - libgtk3
  - libglib2
  - libsecret
  
  On Debian/Ubuntu like distros, they can be installed with this single command :
  ```shell 
  sudo apt install pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev libsecret-1-dev
  ```
- #### Android
  You will need a recent version of [Android Sdk](https://developer.android.com/studio).

  You can then run `flutter doctor` to check if it's detected by flutter.

### Building the App üèóÔ∏è

Please make sure you are on the main branch before proceeding with the build process.
Navigate to the `apps/onyx` directory and execute the following command based on your
target platform:

- To build an APK: `flutter build apk --profile` (the `--profile` flag build the app without the signing key but with
  full optimizations)
    - The APK file is located at `apps/onyx/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.
- To build for Linux: `flutter build linux`
    - The Linux build is located at `apps/onyx/build/linux/x64/release/bundle/Onyx`.
- To build an app bundle: `flutter build appbundle --profile` (the `--profile` flag build the app without the signing
  key but with full optimizations)
    - The app bundle is located at `apps/onyx/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.
- For other platforms, please refer to the Flutter documentation for their respective build locations.

### Development Environment Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To set up your development environment:

1. The required libraries are located in the `packages/` directory.
2. Install Melos, which handles linking libraries directly in the app for development:
    - Install Melos by running: `dart pub global activate melos`.
    - Refer to the [Melos documentation](https://melos.invertase.dev/) for more details.
3. Run `melos bs` or `melos bootstrap` to link the local libraries in the app and retrieve all dependencies.
4. Navigate to the `apps/onyx` directory and run `flutter clean` to ensure a clean environment.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the app.
6. Optionally, you can use `melos generate` to generate automatically generated files (usually not needed unless you
   modify them).
7. Run `melos test` to run unit tests for all the libraries.
8. Run `melos analyze` to perform static analysis on the libraries and the Onyx app.
9. To unlink everything, use `melos clean`.

### End-to-End Testing üß™

To run end-to-end tests:

1. Install Maestro by following the [Maestro documentation](https://maestro.mobile.dev/).
2. Run the following command to install Maestro: `curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash` (Applicable for Mac
   OS, Linux, or Windows with WSL)
3. Navigate to the `apps/onyx/integration_test` directory.
    4. After installing the app on an Android device (physical or virtual), run the following command to execute the
       tests: `maestro test general_test.yaml` Maestro will automatically run the tests.

Now, you're all set to build and test your Flutter app. üéâ
